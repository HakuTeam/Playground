# Sound Wizard
A simple media player written in C#. It uses [WPF](https://github.com/Microsoft/WPF-Samples) and [Mahapps Metro Toolkit](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for the interface.

This is our [C# Advanced OOP teamwork](https://softuni.bg/trainings/1637/c-sharp-oop-advanced-july-2017#lecture-6062) project and its main purpose is to help us learn around a real-world application.

Our goal is to work in a team, to try to follow MVVM design architecture and OOP best practices.
